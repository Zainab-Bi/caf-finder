## Project Description
Nearby Café Finder is a mobile-friendly web app that helps users quickly locate nearby cafés. It shows café names, addresses, ratings, distance, and opening hours, with an interactive map and a “Get Directions” feature.

## Problem Statement
Finding a nearby café can be time-consuming, especially in rural areas or for users with limited digital experience. Existing apps are often cluttered or slow, making it difficult to get accurate and real-time information.

## Features

- Interactive map view with pins for each café
- “Get Directions” button to open navigation
- Filters by distance or ratings
- Save favorite cafés for future visits
- Dark mode toggle and mobile-friendly layout

## AI Tools Used
- **Meta MGX** – Generate app structure, UI, and basic code
- **ChatGPT** – Brainstorming, refining features, and step-by-step guidance
- **AI Chatbot References** – Design user interactions and navigation flow
- **AI Recommendation Tools (Optional)** – Suggest cafés based on user preferences
- **AI Data Analysis Tools (Optional)** – Analyze café data and user feedback

## Design Style
Clean, minimalistic, and modern UI with café-inspired colors. Easy-to-use interface with clear buttons and mobile-responsive design.

## Impact
Helps students and users from rural areas quickly find cafés and nearby resources, improving accessibility, personalized guidance, and user engagement.

## Feedback
